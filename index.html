      <h3>Motivation</h3>
      <p class="activities">Choosing a study was a big deal for me, I've always been interested in a lot of things. With
        Covid it was even
        harder because we didn't have a lot of open days to visit. Because of this I decided to take a gap year to
        carefully think about a study. In my gap year I remembered that when I was younger I thought it was so
        fascinating
        how applications where made and how computers worked. IT is something that's always interested me and to be able
        to learn how to make something on your own and to even turn it in to your job would be amazing!</p>

      <h3 class="idk">Why ICT fits me</h3>
      <p class="fit">The reason why ICT fits me is because I like to be creative but also theoretical. ICT is something that will
        challenge me to be creative and also makes me use my head. The last two weeks I've learned something new
        everytime I was working this site and it amazes me I was able to make this in such a short time! Programming so
        far has been challenging but eventhough I might not look like it sometimes I like to fix problems and find new
        solutions for them.</p>
