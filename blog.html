  <button type="button" class="collapsible">My Study Choice +</button>
  <div class="content">
    <p>Because of Covid I couldn't visit a lot of open days. I did go to SBVM in 2019 and the HZ open day ICT 5
      February.
      <br>
      Choosing a study was a big deal for me, I've always been interested in a lot of things. With Covid it was even
      harder because we didn't have a lot of open days to visit. Because of this I decided to take a gap year to
      carefully think about a study. In my gap year I remembered that when I was younger I thought it was so fascinating
      how applications where made and how computers worked. IT is something that's always interested me and to be able
      to learn how to make something on your own and to even turn it in to your job would be amazing!
      <br>
      After graduading I hope I'll be able to find a job creating websites or applications for a company. Maybe even
      start on something on my own. Definetly creating and styling is something I'm very interested in!

  <button type="button" class="collapsible">Programming Experience +</button>
  <div class="content">
    <p>Before I started this studie I had no programming experience whatsoever. The last couple weeks was
      all new to me.
      It wasn't easy to learn to build a website in such a short time but in the end it worked out. I'm very curious to
      see what we'll learn the next four years!</p>

  <button type="button" class="collapsible">First Feedback +</button>
  <div class="content">
    <p>
      The Feedback:
      <br>
      <br>Motivation
      <br>Good to read you remembered to be fascinated by how applications were made and you have made a well-written
      argumentation towards your study choice. Was there a specific application you liked most and tried to figure out
      how it was made? What about being able to make a software application yourself is of interest to you? In other
      words, could you answer the Why or where that fascination is coming from?
      <br>
      <br>Future Career

      <br>I would advise you try and find a ICT company in the field of software development or mobile phone app
      development
      to find out if this would be of interest to you. Research the company as if you would want to apply for a job
      there today. It will give you more information and direction. It can also trigger inspiration for your studies
      keeping you on the right track.
      <br>
      <br>SWOT

      <br>What do you need to put in place, work on or organize in order to be able to have less impact on study
      progress
      because of your weaknesses mentioned? For instance do you why it's hard for you to not start sooner with work? if
      you figure out what that is for you you can start working on avoiding the situation altogether. Same question for
      concentrating. How could you increase this or organize an environment to support?
      <br>
      <br>My POV:
      <br>The feedback helped me to really think about what I want to do with this studie. The assignment and feedback
      together made me realise that creating websites and applictaions is really interesting to me. So far as the
      feedback on the SWOT-Analysis is a little different hard for me... I know what causes me to keep postponing my
      work, but it's not something you can change overnight.

  <div class="content">
    <p>
      The reality of modern F1 is that of a complex and intertwined operation, every part of which needs to perform near
      its limit if success is to be achieved.
      <br>
      <br>Working for a F1 team means you'll be working in a very large team, but all with the same target. Hundreds of
      IT'ers are looking at data to find that one thing they can improve.
      <br>
      <br>"We are looking for an enthusiastic Junior Electronics Engineer to join our outstanding Electronics
      department. In
      our purpose-built Electronics facility, we have the tools required to develop new technologies, deliver exciting
      research projects and above all support our dynamic team of Engineers."
      <br>
      <br>At RedBull Racing you can work at the factory (England) as well as on the spot travelling with the team from
      race to race. I would love to be able to be a part of the RedBull Racing team, either at the factory or next to
      the track. It's something i'm very pasionate about.

  <button type="button" class="collapsible">Company Safari Google +</button>
  <div class="content">
    <p>
      Google is one of the younger companies but now one of the largest today. It was founded in 2004 and has 85.000
      employes. They operate one of the worlds most used web applications and search engines wich is their mission and
      responsibility.
      <br>
      <br> Google is one of the biggest companies there is if you're looking for a job in IT. For me it seems like a
      real challange to work at a big company that has so much impact on peoples lives.

  <button type="button" class="collapsible">Company Safari Bomont +</button>
  <div class="content">
    <p>Bomont is a fairly local company where i work on weekends. It's very family oriÃ«nted not only with clothes but
      the whole team as well. I think it could be a real challenge to work at a smaller company and help it expand into
      the rest of the country of maybe even outside of that.
      <br>
      <br>
      I've been on the headquarters more than ones and already know some things about working there and it would be very
      nice to be able to help make it even better.
