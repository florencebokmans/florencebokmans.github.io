    <button type="button" class="collapsible">My Study Choice +</button>
    <div class="content">
      <p>Because of Covid I couldn't visit a lot of open days. I did go to SBVM in 2019 and the HZ open day ICT 5 February.
        <br>
        Choosing a study was a big deal for me, I've always been interested in a lot of things. With Covid it was even
        harder because we didn't have a lot of open days to visit. Because of this I decided to take a gap year to
        carefully think about a study. In my gap year I remembered that when I was younger I thought it was so fascinating
        how applications where made and how computers worked. IT is something that's always interested me and to be able
        to learn how to make something on your own and to even turn it in to your job would be amazing!
        <br>
        After graduading I hope I'll be able to find a job creating websites or applications for a company. Maybe even
        start on something on my own. Definetly creating and styling is something I'm very interested in!</p>

    <button type="button" class="collapsible">Programming Experience +</button>
    <div class="content">
      <p>Before I started this studie I had no programming experience whatsoever. The last couple weeks was
        all new to me.
        It wasn't easy to learn to build a website in such a short time but in the end it worked out. I'm very curious to
        see what we'll learn the next four years!</p>

    <button type="button" class="collapsible">First Feedback +</button>
    <div class="content">
      <p>
        The Feedback:
        <br>
        <br>Motivation
        <br>Good to read you remembered to be fascinated by how applications were made and you have made a well-written
        argumentation towards your study choice. Was there a specific application you liked most and tried to figure out
        how it was made? What about being able to make a software application yourself is of interest to you? In other
        words, could you answer the Why or where that fascination is coming from?
        <br>
        <br>Future Career
  
        <br>I would advise you try and find a ICT company in the field of software development or mobile phone app development
        to find out if this would be of interest to you. Research the company as if you would want to apply for a job
        there today. It will give you more information and direction. It can also trigger inspiration for your studies
        keeping you on the right track.
        <br>
        <br>SWOT
  
        <br>What do you need to put in place, work on or organize in order to be able to have less impact on study progress
        because of your weaknesses mentioned? For instance do you why it's hard for you to not start sooner with work? if
        you figure out what that is for you you can start working on avoiding the situation altogether. Same question for
        concentrating. How could you increase this or organize an environment to support?
        <br>
        <br>My POV:
        <br>The feedback helped me to really think about what I want to do with this studie. The assignment and feedback
        together made me realise that creating websites and applictaions is really interesting to me. So far as the
        feedback on the SWOT-Analysis is a little different hard for me... I know what causes me to keep postponing my
        work, but it's not something you can change overnight.
